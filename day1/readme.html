(12-02-18) today i covered selectors, images and background properties,  css combinators.

Css-Selectors:

 selectors are used to select the html elements into css.
 	1. class selector--> class can be used for reusability. one class can be applied for many elements for reusability. and have to mention . before class in class
 	2.Id--> id is always unique. we should use same id only one time . and we have to use # while using id in css
 	3.attribute selector---> is used to select the html elements but here we are selecting elements based on attribute that element having. 
 	4.*--> is also called as universal selector. is used to select the all elements at a time. we do it for normalizing the page.
 	5.grouping-selector --> is used to select the different elements as a group.


 CSS Combinators: 

 	Space: this is a descendent selector. usedto select the descendent elements from the html to css. we can target particular elements so that the same other elements won't effect.

 	GreaterThan(>): this is used to select the immediate children of the parent element.

 	Plus(+): this is used to select the one adjucent element of any elemnt. nothing but sibling.

 	~ combinator: --> this is used to select the gemeral sibligs of any elements. difference between ~ and + is no of siblings. = can select one sibling and ~ can select all siblings to an element.

 Images and Background Properties:

 	<img src="image path" alt="alternate text">
 	and 
 	background image.
 	and discussed properties are:
 	 background-image: url('image path');
 	 background-repeat--> if bg image is repeating then we can stop repetaion of background image.
 	 background-size----> is used to make the image cover the whole element background even the image is smaller than the elemnt for which we are giving background image.
 	 background-position-->is used to decide the position of the background image wether left or right or top center etc.
 	 background-attatchment--> is having only one value i.e fixed. and it is used to make the element fixed to page. and we can make paralax effect by making the background image as fixed.
